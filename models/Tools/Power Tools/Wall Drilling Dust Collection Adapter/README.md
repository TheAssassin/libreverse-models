# Wall Drilling Dust Collection Adapter

These models were inspired by [Marius Hornberger's Shop vac adapter for one-man wall drilling](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3286346). They're most useful when drilling holes into a wall when there's noone around who could hold the vacuum cleaner's hose close to the new hole. The cleaner's vacuum will make sure these adapters stick to the wall while it's running, so you just place it on the wall where you need the hole, pick up your drill and let it do its thing. All the dust and gravel will automatically be sucked into the vacuum's hose, leaving you with a nice, clean hole and a dust-free wall and floor.


### Revisions

There's several iterations of this model. The first version was very similar to Marius's design, however there's been a few design issues with it. First and foremost, the distance between the vacuum hose and the wall was too large, making the adapter likely to tip and then come off the wall. Also, the hole in the adapter was a little too small, making it hard to see what you were doing. But the biggest issue is how the stream of air and dust is directed. It seemed to be pushed against the wall before being sucked into the vacuum, leaving a trace of dirt that could even grind into the paint.

Mk. 2 is the next attempt with a custom design that is more simplistic but fixes the issues mentioned. For regular holes, it's pretty much ideal -- the air flow isn't restricted at all inside the adapter, and even less strong vacuums like household ones work perfectly well with it. The most notable difference is, however, that the vacuum pipe is moved close to the hole, which helps keep the dust from being pushed back on the wall. The only drawback is that it's rather tall (its height is defined by the "vacuum elbow").

Therefore, a Mk. 3 was created from the Mk. 2 model which reduces the height of the adapter near the drill entry hole. It's a tradeoff but it appears to work well with all vacuums as well. Being less tall, it's easier to see what you're doing, too. (Arguably, the ~20mm additional depth for drilling isn't the key feature here.)


### How to print

The models are rotated "standing" on the pipe holder (the part which takes the vacuum's "elbow") on the build platform. This should ensure the pipe holder is perfectly round (the other round parts are way less critical). No supports needed.

**Brim or raft are absolutely necessary!** The surface area of the pipe holder is *very* small.


### Assembly

You need some weather sealing strips, ideally self-adhesive ones. The width and height are configurable. Cheap black strips should work just fine.

Just glue the strips carefully into the slot. You'll notice that near the vacuum hose attachment, there's no slot as you'd expect it but the pipe will protrude into the slot. You have two options: skip that section or just put some stripping there as well. One can cut down the projecting tape easily with a sharp blade, and the cut doesn't have to be perfect. With a good vac, even if that section is skipped, the part should stick to the wall, too, though.

The default value for the inner diameter of 34.8. Depending on your printer and its precision, this should create a nice fit on the vacuum elbow part. If it's too lose, a little bit of tape usually fixes the issues as well (use some proper tape, you don't need a lot and the part will probably last for a couple years!). If too tight, well, you'll have to increase the diameter and print it again.
