# Alternative Power Supply Cover for Ender-2

This is an alternative back cover for the power supply shipped with the Creality Ender-2.

In the original setup, the power cable was wired directly to the power supply terminals, without a power switch or alike. Usability wise this was very annoying, as one was limited to the original cable. Also, that cable didn't provide any kind of strain relief, so one had to be very careful. Also, to cut the annoying power supply fan, one either had to use an external power switch (e.g., one that can be plugged into the socket and into which one plugged the power supply cable) or just unplug it from the wall socket.

This alternative cover is longer than the original one so that a C-14 connector as well as a switch to cut the power fit inside it. The screw hole layout was reproduced from the original cover, it should fit as a drop-in replacement.


### Additional parts needed

- a C-14 connector (also known as "Kaltger√§testecker" in German)
- a suitable power switch that is capable of a current of at least 2 Amperes (real Amperes, not Chinese ones)
