# Mini Solder Spool

This spool has been developed using OpenSCAD 2019.05. It was inspired by the [Improved Mini Solder Spool](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:277143) by *Virago*. This model, however, was not very nice to touch, and also lacked source files which prevents people from customizing it to the size they need.
