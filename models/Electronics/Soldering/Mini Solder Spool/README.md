# Mini Solder Spool

This spool has been developed using OpenSCAD 2019.05. It was inspired by the [Improved Mini Solder Spool](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:277143) by *Virago*. This model, however, was not very nice to touch (it has very sharp edges), and also lacked source files which prevents people from customizing it to the size they need.

Since the model uses OpenSCAD, it's easy to change the dimensions for your needs. The source code uses Mathâ„¢ to derive the dimensions for the optimal groove (using the formulae for circular segments). It will show the user an error if the entered dimensions are invalid (i.e., if there were overhangs that could not be printed).


### How to print

The model is fairly easy to print, no supports needed. Tested with PLA and PETG, but it should work with almost any filament.
