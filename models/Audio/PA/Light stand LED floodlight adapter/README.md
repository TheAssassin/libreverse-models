# Light stand adapter for LED floodlight

This little adapter allows for mounting a cheap LED floodlight in a light stand. This way, one can set up some cheap light outside an event venue.

The cheap LED floodlights typically are meant to be mounted on a vertical wall. However, most light stands require a shaft to be inserted into the vertical pipe.


### How to use

First, insert a hex head screw into the adapter (there's a hex hole for the head). Then, mount the mounting bracket of the floodlight on the screw, and tighten it with a suitable nut.

*Note: you can also insert a nut into the adapter, and then use a screw to mount the floodlight.*

This adapter is inserted into the stand's pipe. Tighten the fastening screw of the stand. Done!
