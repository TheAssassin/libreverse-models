# Desk Cable Entry Ring

This parameterizable ring was designed to fit in a round hole in a desk that allows cables to pass through the tabletop. It covers the rough edges and surfaces that the typical particle board tabletop usually has, and allows cables to pass through nicely and without being damaged.

By default, the ring has a slot on one side. By bending the ring open, one can wrap it around existing cables, allowing the ring to be retrofit in an existing hole. You should print the ring slightly larger than your hole if using a slot to make sure it's a tight fit (you can always file down the ring's edges a little. The slot can also be disabled completely (not recommended!).

The ring has been turned upside down to make printing easier.
